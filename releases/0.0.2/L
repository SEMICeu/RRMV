         Introduction
     </h2>
     
-
+<p>As EU policies evolve, the demand for data in the form of reporting requirements from Member States and other stakeholders continues to grow. This may potentially lead to an increase in the regulatory reporting burden, as stakeholders need to increasingly monitor regulations to be fully compliant with them.</p>  
+  
+    <p>To address this issue, the European Commission, in its <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2023-03/Communication_Long-term-competitiveness.pdf">16 March 2023 Communication on the Long-term competitiveness of the EU</a>, committed to "make a fresh push to rationalize and simplify reporting requirements for companies and administrations with first proposals for each of the green, digital and economic thematic areas before the autumn. The aim should be to reduce such burdens by 25%, without undermining the related policy objectives.”</p>  
+  
+    <p>In line with this effort, streamlining regulatory reporting burdens has been identified as a critical policy need for the European Commission's proposals. The European Commission aims to eliminate redundancies and harmonise reporting requirements to assist policy officers in understanding existing frameworks in detail. By avoiding duplicate requests and considering factors such as dates and reporting frequencies, the Commission seeks to optimise new requirements effectively.</p>  
+  
+    <p>These efforts translated into the <a href="https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/better-legislation-smoother-implementation/news/streamlining-regulatory-reporting-sortis-project-results">Study on Regulatory Reporting Standards (SORTIS)</a>, a combined effort of the University of Bologna, the University of Liège, and the European Commission. The project aimed to define a vocabulary to standardise and organise regulatory reporting metadata of EU legislations and to develop standard formulations to be able to identify the appropriate data of reporting requirements.</p>  
+  
+    <p>The results of this study included a definition of a model known as Reporting Requirements Metadata Vocabulary (RRMV). This model aimed at defining the set of concepts and categories contained in reporting requirements within existing EU legislations and define their properties and the relations between them. It could serve as a base for interoperable reporting requirements monitoring solutions that could extract information and automatically feed regulatory reporting databases across different policy domains to be accessed by stakeholders.</p>  
+  
+    <p>The aim of the model is to assist in the policy drafting process by automatically feeding a reporting requirements monitoring solution in turn minimising the duplication of reporting requirements.</p>
